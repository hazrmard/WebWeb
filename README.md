Mapping links to a site.

My first project using jQuery.

This project attempts to bypass restrictions due to Same-Origin policy. It uses [YQL - Yahoo Query Language](https://developer.yahoo.com/yql) to extract links from other sites. This way my server does not have to download external site content and waste bandwidth and I do not have to use less robust methods like iFrames to parse sites for links.
